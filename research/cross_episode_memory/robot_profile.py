"""What the reorder stack needs to know about a robot.

The tools were written against RB-Y1 and name its joints directly -- about 220
references to `right_arm_*`, `torso_*`, `head_0`, `ee_site_r`, `right_finger_act`
and friends. A second embodiment cannot be configured in, only ported, unless
those names come from one place. This is that place.

Profiles are data, not behaviour. Anything that differs structurally rather than
by name -- RB-Y1 has a torso and a pan/tilt head, the Franka has neither -- is
expressed as an empty tuple, so callers branch on "does this robot have a head"
instead of on the robot's identity.
